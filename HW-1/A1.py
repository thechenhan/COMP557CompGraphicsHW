"""
Code layout:
--------------------
Here are some notes on how the code is organized so that you can find your way
around the code. 

There are 3 source files provided with this starter code. They are:
A1.py, A1Main.py, A1DrawHelperFunctions.py

A1.py: You ONLY NEED to work with A1.py. Descriptions are given below

A1Main.py : This is the file that you'll execute to start the application. It
contains all the windowing functions and makes appropriate calls to functions
int A1.py or updates variables in A1.py. You DO NOT NEED to make any changes to it.

A1DrawHelperFunctions: This file contains some common drawing routines. Again 
you DO NOT NEED to deal with this file.

Now back to A1.py ...
The parts where you'll be adding your code are marked by the
TODO markers along with "BEGIN SOLUTION" and "END SOLUTION" comments. 
More specifically the following functions need to be filled in:

drawScene() for Q1
Viewport3() for Q3
Viewport4()
perspective(fovy, aspect, near, far)
drawMovingViewVolume() for Q2

(NOTE: Some IDEs let you navigate to the TODO section. For instance spyder
puts a check mark on the left and a blue bar near the scroll bar. 
You can click on the blue bar to navigate to the TODO section. If you're
using spyder you can also use the "Outline" pane from View-> Windows and Toolbars -> Outline
to find commented sections for adding code.)

Where to start?
----------------
To get an idea about how things are put together you can start from the main 
function in A1Main.py (see if __name__ == '__main__'). We use
the GLUT library for windowing (i.e. window creation, update, mouse/keyboard, etc.)

We implemented a class called Window which handles all the necessary glut 
callback function calls such as drawing on the display, mouse and keyboard handling, etc.
This assingment does not require you to modify anything in the Window class. 
(However, if you want to see how the main camera variables such as pan, tilt and eye position are 
updated you can look at the Window.keyboard, Window.mouse, and Window.motion functions)

How does rendering work?
-------------------------
Everytime glut needs to refresh the display it'll call Window.display function
which in turn calls drawMain() (there are a few other calls but they are not relevant
for this assignment). We've setup glut to do double-buffering so the rendering is first done
in the back buffer and finally moved to the front buffer after glutSwapBuffers is called.
This call is also made in Window.display function.

At every frame Window.display calls drawMain(). drawMain() in turn calls the
functions for Viewport 1 to 4. The viewports do not depend on each other, they make
use of the global variables that are defined at the beginning of this file. The 
viewport functions also do not modify any of those global variables.

How does animation work?
------------------------
We use glut's glutTimerFunc function which calls Window.timer_func at a time
specified in the Timer_ms variable (all of this is in A1Main.py and just to 
restate are not part of the code that you submit). This function in turn 
updates all the animation variables (only the moving camera related variables)
and tells glut to update the display. 

Numpy:
------
For many operations we use the numpy module. We imported some of the commonly
used functions by name. We also imported numpy as np. So if you want to use
some function from there you can use "np.". 

NOTE: In serveral places we used np.eye(N). The eye here refers to the Identity
matrix that is implemented by NumPy which we imported as np. It does NOT have
anything to do with the eye coordinate. np.eye(N) will create an Identity 
matrix of size N x N.
(http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.eye.html)

Drawing using GLU:
------------------
GLU functions usually require a handle to a Quadric. In the starter code we
created a handle called myQuadric (initialized in Window.__init__) which you can reuse.
